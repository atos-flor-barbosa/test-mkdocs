# Using a third party theme

Small description on how I changed this documentation's theme to the mkdocs-material theme.

## Material

So I chose an external theme, and first thing I had to do, was to install it through pip 

        pip install mkdocs-material

There are other alternatives to download this theme, for instance, through git, for more info, check [here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/).


After that, just change the theme specified on the config file (mkdocs.yml)

        theme:
            name: material
