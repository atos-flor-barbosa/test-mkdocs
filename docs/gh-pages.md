## Deploy to Github pages

Simply run the following command to deploy your documentation's site to Github pages

```sh
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

> You should never edit files in your pages repository by hand if you're using
    the `gh-deploy` command because you will lose your work the next time you
    run the command.
