## Adding more pages

It's really simple to add more pages to your documentation, you just have to create your new markdown file, add your contents to it, and inside the config file (mkdocs.yml) add the new .md to your nav.

## Deploying

MkDocs has a very useful command you can use if you are using github, and want to deploy to github pages, just using

        mkdocs gh-deploy
